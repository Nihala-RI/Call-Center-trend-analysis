I made this mini project on Call center data using Power bi.
Our objective was to analyse the trend in agent performance and customer behaviour.
The KPIs are overall customer satisfaction,total calls, total calls answered and abandon,total resolved calls, total number of agents ,calls by time.
Various graphs such as pie chart, donut chart and bar graphs are used here to analyse the data. Some cards are also displayed to show the KPIs .
At the end , we analysed that customer satisfaction rate is only an average of 3.45 , number of unanswered calls and unresolved calls are present .Hence more active performance from agents should be invested for the betterment of call center.
